__Bluetooth Challenge__  
Your challenge is to implement any bluetooth device that you have handy into an Ionic application for Android. This should be extremely basic visually since we are specifically interested in the bluetooth implementation.

If you do not have a bluetooth device available and would be unable to complete this task, please let us know.

__Requirements__  
Implement any BLE peripheral that you have into the sample Ionic app that has been provided to you, including the following bluetooth interactions:
Scanning for devices and showing a list that you can select to pair from
Pairing the device
Transmitting data and showing visually
Disconnecting from the device
Include some unit tests

__Guidelines__  
The visuals are not important as long as there is something to show that these actions have been completed (ie. a list of scanned devices that you can choose to pair with, and some visual representation of the data)

__Submission__  
Send us a link to your project on GitHub with any instructions as well as details about the bluetooth device(s) you used
Include screenshots for the visuals of your project (as we won't have the device on hand)
Include any commentary that you would like us to know
